better autocompletion for python 3.6 in notepad++

## Description

This project aims to enhance Notepad++ with advanced autocompletion for Python 3.
Why?
If you work on your laptop while without power supply, you notice that popular IDE's drain too much energy.
Opposite, notepad++ consumption is quite modest compared to any IDE.

## Installation
* close all instances of Notepad Plus Plus (NPP)
* backup original python.xml in %NPP_FOLDER%\Plugines\API
* copy new python.xml into %NPP_FOLDER%\Plugines\API

## Results:
The new functions / modules / classes definition is about 3.5M long compared to standard 65K definition.
