better autocompletion for python 3.6 in notepad++

## Description

This project aims to enhance Notepad++ with advanced autocompletion for Python 3.
Why?
If you work on your laptop while without power supply, you notice that popular IDE's drain too much energy.
In contrast, Notepad++ consumption is quite modest compared to any IDE.

Tested on Notepad++ 7.5.6 32 bit.

## Installation

* backup original python.xml in %NPP_FOLDER%\plugins\APIs
* copy new python.xml into %NPP_FOLDER%\plugins\APIs

## Results:
The new functions / modules / classes definition file is more than 570% times bigger compared to default definitions file.
